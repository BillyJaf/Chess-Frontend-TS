# Typescript Chess Bot Frontend

## Authors
- Billy Jaffray

## Overview
A frontend client for a chess client-server application.   
Checkout the project deployed using AWS amplify [here](https://staging.d12fedjdowqalp.amplifyapp.com/).
Checkout the backend [here](https://github.com/BillyJaf/Chess-AWS-Lambda).

## Background and Motivation
I enjoy both playing chess and programming - creating a chess bot is a natural extension.
The goal of the project is to build a dynamic and interactive frontend using React to complement the chess-backend I have already created; the chess bot would be useless without the ability to play against it!

## Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
- Create an interactive and visually appealing frontend that uses my chess bot backend.
- Learn frontend design fundamentals / industry standards.
- Strengthen my skills with the React framework.

### Non-Goals
- Programming any chess logic (this should all be handled by the backend).
